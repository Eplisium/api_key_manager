## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)
- SQLite3

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eplisium/API-Storage.git
cd API-Storage
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Initialize the database and run migrations:
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade
```

## Configuration

The application uses a simple configuration setup with the following defaults:

- Database: SQLite (`keys.db` in the application directory)
- Server: Runs on `localhost:5000`
- Logging: Configured via `logging.conf`, outputs to `api_key_manager.log`
- Database Features:
  - Automatic timestamps for creation and updates
  - Unique constraints per project
  - Position tracking for ordered lists
  - Relationship management between keys and projects
  - Automatic cascade operations
  - Transaction support with rollback capability

To modify these settings, you can edit the following files:
- `app.py`: Database URL and application settings
- `logging.conf`: Logging configuration
  - Log level control
  - Log format customization
  - Log rotation settings
  - Separate loggers for different components

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask development server:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`

## API Endpoints

### Keys

- `GET /keys` - List all keys
  - Query parameters:
    - `project_id`: Filter keys by project
    - `show_all`: Show all keys including those in projects

- `GET /keys/<id>` - Get a specific key
- `POST /keys` - Create a new key
  ```json
  {
    "name": "API Key Name",
    "key": "your-api-key",
    "description": "Optional description",
    "used_with": "Service name",
    "project_id": null
  }
  ```
- `PUT /keys/<id>` - Update a key
- `DELETE /keys/<id>` - Delete a key
- `PATCH /keys/<id>/project` - Update key's project
- `PATCH /keys/<id>/reorder` - Reorder key within project

### Projects

- `GET /projects` - List all projects
- `POST /projects` - Create a new project
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Project Name"
  }
  ```
- `PUT /projects/<id>` - Update a project
- `DELETE /projects/<id>` - Delete a project

## Development

### Database Migrations

The application uses Flask-Migrate for database migrations:

1. Create a new migration after model changes:
```bash
flask db migrate -m "Migration message"
```

2. Apply migrations:
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Checking Database Status

Use the built-in database check command:
```bash
flask check-db
```

## Security Considerations

1. The application is designed for local use or internal networks
2. The default configuration uses hardcoded values suitable for development
3. For production deployment:
   - Change the secret key in `app.py`
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Use HTTPS if exposed to the internet
   - Consider using environment variables for sensitive data
4. Regularly backup the SQLite database file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Database initialization errors:
   - Ensure SQLite is installed
   - Check write permissions in the application directory
   - Run `flask db init` if this is a fresh installation
   - Check `api_key_manager.log` for detailed error messages

2. Key management issues:
   - Check the logs in `api_key_manager.log`
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Ensure proper JSON format in API requests

3. UI issues:
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify all static files are being served correctly

4. Migration issues:
   - If you get "No such table" errors, ensure you've run all migrations
   - For fresh installations, run the full migration sequence:
     ```bash
     flask db init
     flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
     flask db upgrade
     ```
